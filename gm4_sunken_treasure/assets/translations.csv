text.gm4.dearest_audrey.1,I drank all my beer
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.10.1,What's your
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.10.2,phone number; bottled messages
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.10.3,are hard to make!
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.11.1,I find myself stranded
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.11.2,on a barren island.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.11.3,"An enderdragon took me here,"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.11.4,please rescue me.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.12,Put the money in the bag.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.13.1,The compass you sent me
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.13.2,"seems to only point in the direction of our love,"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.13.3,but that seems to have vanished long ago.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.13.4,"Please, get help, even if it's the last thing you do."
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.14.1,I fear this may
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.14.2,be my last attempt at finding help.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.14.3,I just want you to know... I always... loved...
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.14.4,your sister.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.15.1,I've been here for 3 months
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.15.2,"and after several attempts to find food,"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.15.3,"shelter, or even enough water... I'm giving up."
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.15.4,"Tell my family I love them, but most importantly,"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.15.5,"Audrey, I love you."
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.16.1,I know exactly who
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.16.2,you are - play along. I don't have any
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.16.3,money. I burned it all trying to make a
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.16.4,fire. But I can tell you I've developed
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.16.5,a very particular set of skills. Skills
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.16.6,that'll make Bear Grylls quake in his boots.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.17.1,I'm in the sink sand.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.17.2,"If you find my head, hang it on the"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.17.3,wall of fame.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.18.1,Each day that passes
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.18.2,"is immensely terrible, painful and sad."
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.18.3,Getting away from you just didn't
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.18.4,improve anything.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.19.1,I write this on paper
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.19.2,made from native plants and ink
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.19.3,from a squid I wrangled. I like it here.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.19.4,I found a dungeon. I'm setting up a mob
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.19.5,grinder and never coming home.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.2.1,My boat was
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.2.2,sunk by a lily-pad and now I'm
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.2.3,stuck on this island.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.20.1,punching wood
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.20.2,for logs doesn't work in real life.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.1,I don't know how to spell
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.2,"your name, nor do I know you, but I"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.3,"do know that I love you, I feel like I"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.4,have a mutual connection. After
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.5,you ordered the pizza with cheezy
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.6,crust and pinapple I just lost it. Oh
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.7,no Clair you got shot... I mean Audrey.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.3.8,I don't mind that you're chunky
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.4.1,when I listen
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.4.2,"to the ocean, all I hear is your"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.4.3,snoring and I can't sleep. Please
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.4.4,"silence your snoring... please, I"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.4.5,need sleep.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.5.1,How's your
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.5.2,"day going? I'm good, BUT I'VE"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.5.3,BEEN STRANDED FOR 20 YEARS!
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.5.4,Thanks for your response.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.6.1,I'm stranded
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.6.2,"in the middle of nowhere,"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.6.3,surrounded by things that
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.6.4,aren't cubic.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.7.1,I mean Hannah...
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.7.2,"wait, no... is it Denise? ...Anyway,"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.7.3,I love you.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.8.1,I seem to have
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.8.2,"run out of clean water, if you could"
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.8.3,return this bottle with something to
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.8.4,drink that would be wonderful.
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.9.1,I have no
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.9.2,internet so I am sending you
text.gm4.dearest_audrey.9.3,a bottle.

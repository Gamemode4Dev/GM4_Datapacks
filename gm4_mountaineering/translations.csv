text.gm4.guidebook.mountaineering.crampons,"Wearing crampons allows users to scale rocky cliffs. Having empty hands helps with scaling.\n\nUsers can continuously climb rocky cliffs, but staying still will result in falling."
text.gm4.guidebook.mountaineering.skis,"Wearing skis allows users to move quickly over snowy surfaces.\n\nContinuously traveling downwards on snowy terrain increases speed, but traveling on non-snowy areas reduces the speed."
text.gm4.guidebook.mountaineering.poles,"Holding a Ski Pole in each hand can help when jumping. This is best paired with Skis.\n\nWhen using poles while skiing, a jump enhancement is given if going up a short ramp. Poles also make it easier to gain speed while skiing."

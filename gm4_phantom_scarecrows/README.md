### Features
- Equipping a skull of an undead mob (Skeleton, Zombie or Wither Skeleton) to an armor stand along with a chestplate enchanted with a curse (Vanishing or Binding) will transform the armor stand into a Phantom Scarecrow.
- When a phantom flies within 25 blocks of the scarecrow, a homing firework will be fired towards the targeted phantom that will kill it in one shot.
- Adds one new custom advancement for getting struck by a homing phantom missile.

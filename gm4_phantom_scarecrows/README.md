# Phantom Scarecrows<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

Do you regret that phantoms were added to the game but don't want to change any gamerules? This modular datapack lets you create phantom scarecrows that shoot homing fireqorkd projectiles at nearby phantoms to protect your base! <!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- Adding a head of an undead mob (Skeleton, zombie or wither skeleton skull) to an armor stand along with a chestplate enchanted with a curse (Curse of Vanishing or Binding) will transform the armor stand into a phantom scarecrow.
- The armor stand will become uninteractable and raise its arms when it's in shooting mode.
- When a phantom flies within a 25 block radius of the scarecrow a homing firework will be fired towards the targeted phantom that will kill it in one shot.
- Adds one new custom advancement that is rewarded if the player stands too close to the exploded phantom to the point where they take damage.

### Features
- When grass or dirt is stepped on it has a chance of turning into dirt or coarse dirt respectively.
- Flowers, grass and other plants will be trampled and break if walked on enough.
- Adds two new custom advancements to be obtained by trampling enough blocks.

### Compatability 
When playing with other Gamemode 4 datapacks, adds some bonus features:
- Adds the Celaro shamir when used with the [Metallurgy]($dynamicLink:gm4_metallurgy) datapack.
- Use the [Boots of Ostara]($dynamicLink:gm4_boots_of_ostara) module to spread nature instead of trampling it.

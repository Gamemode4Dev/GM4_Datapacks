The power of ant-aging, but now for mobs! (And yes, it is stolen from Pokemon)<!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features

  - Guardians become Elder Guardians when there are at least 5 others nearby for atleast 20 minutes
  - Piglins become Piglin Brutes when there less than 2 Brutes within 32 blocks for 1 hour
  - Slimes become Magma Cubes when in The Nether for over 30 minutes
- An Everstone can be obtained from mining stone during a full moon

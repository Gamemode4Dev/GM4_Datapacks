# Weighted Armour<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

A great way to add some variety to your UHC tournaments, or just some spice for everyday monster fighting. Weighted armour slows the player down depending on their armour points. Players now have the tactical choice between speed and protection. <!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- Slowness levels increase with armour points.
- Full leather armour causes no slowness, while full diamond armour causes slowness III.
- Players should consider what level of protection they need for different activities, and have a few different outfits to wear accordingly
- When used together with [Metallurgy]($dynamicLink:gm4_metallurgy) data pack, the Helious shamir can be used to counteract the weight of armour.

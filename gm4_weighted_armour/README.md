# Weighted Armour<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

A great way to add some variety to your UHC tournaments, or just some spice for everyday monster fighting. Weighted armour slows the player down depending on their armor points. Players now have the tactical choice between speed and protection. <!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features:
- Slowness levels increase with armor points.
- Full leather armor causes no slowness, while full diamond armor causes slowness III.
- Players should consider what level of protection they need for different activities, and have a few different outfits to wear accordingly

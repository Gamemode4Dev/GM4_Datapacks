# Liquid Minecarts<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

Normal Liquid Tanks can't move, but with this datapack they can ride on rails!<!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- Expands the Gamemode 4 datapack [Liquid Tanks]($dynamicLink:gm4_liquid_tanks) by allowing them to be mobile and work on rails
- Allows a liquid tank to load/unload fluid like a hopper does to a chest
- An activator rail forces the tank cart to fully empty itself

### Features
- Any items with the Animi Shamir on them will survive after you die and then respawn - like the modded "Soulbound" enchantment
- Builds on Gamemode 4's comprehensive and fun take on enchantments with the Metallurgy system.
- Respects the "Curse of Vanishing", so will not return the item if on a tool with the Curse and you die.

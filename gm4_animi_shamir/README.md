# Animi Shamir<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

You can now cheat death! Or... at least your items can.<!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- Any items with the Animi Shamir on them will survive after you die and then respawn - like the modded "Soulbound" enchantment
- Builds on Gamemode 4's comprehensive and fun take on enchantments with the [Metallurgy]($dynamicLink:gm4_metallurgy) system.
- Respects "Curse of Vanishing", so items will not return if on a tool with the Curse and you die.

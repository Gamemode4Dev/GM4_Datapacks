### Features
- Interacting with a decorated pot or empty flower pot while holding any one of the supported items will plant it in the pot.
- Interacting with a flower pot from this module with an empty hand will empty the flower pot, just like vanilla flower pots. Decorated Pots will have to be broken to unplant that which you have potted.
- Decorated pot plants often have multiple stages for a plant.

# Cooler Caves<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

Modifying cave generation even further by upping the cool factor...<!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- In Deserts, sandstone generates in place of stone; sand replaces gravel and Mineshafts generate with Dark Oak
- Ocean Mineshafts generate prismarine supports instead of oak planks.
- Ice based biomes generate snow/blue ice related blocks in place of andesite/stone

A full list of blocks replaced and in which biomes can be seen on the [Wiki](https://wiki.gm4.co/Orbis/Cooler_Caves).

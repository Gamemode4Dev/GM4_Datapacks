# Shroomites<!--$headerTitle--><!--$pmc:delete-->

Mycelium has always been a bit weird, which explains why it has always been locked up on an island.<!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- Mooshrooms now have a chance of spawning a Shroomite shroom
- This can then spread mycelium and create more spores
- Spores move very slowly, so take several minecraft days to spread and infect blocks

text.gm4.guidebook.spawner_minecarts.description,Spawners can be picked up with Minecarts.\n\nOnce a spawner is in a minecart it cannot be ejected and requires charging to spawn mobs.
text.gm4.guidebook.spawner_minecarts.pick_up,"To capture a spawner, place a minecart under it, then a downwards piston above the spawner, and finally a redstone block above the piston."
text.gm4.guidebook.spawner_minecarts.recharging,"Spawner minecarts require charge to spawn mobs. They passively charge over time.\n\nWhen on a powered rail, it will stop spawning mobs and start actively charging by consuming flowers in a 9x9 area."
text.gm4.guidebook.spawner_minecarts.recharging_1,"Some flowers charge the spawner minecart twice as fast as others; this differs in each world.\n\nWhen a spawner minecart fully recharges, it will activate any detector rails it is on."

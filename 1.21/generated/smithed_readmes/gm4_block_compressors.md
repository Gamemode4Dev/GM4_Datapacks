Store even more blocks in a single slot by squishing them within an inch of their cubic-self.<!--$pmc:headerSize-->

### Features
- The same item type can be compressed to 1/64 of its size - eg 64 wool blocks becomes 1 compressed wool block, which itself can be stacked to 64.
- Adds a machine block that can automate compression for storage systems 
- A chest full of shulker boxes, each full of *64 compressed items, can hold 2,985,984 items... think of the efficiency!

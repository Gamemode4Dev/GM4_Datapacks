Ever felt like minecraft could do with a bit more immersion? This modular datapack adds a new cool interaction to your survival world in the form of self generating paths! When you walk between two places enough, a desire line will form transforming your grass into coarse dirt all on its own! <!--$pmc:headerSize-->

- Adds two new custom advancements to be obtained by trampling enough blocks.

### Compatability
